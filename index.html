                <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed 
                   in Europe during the eighteenth century.[1] Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking 
                   long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.
                   
                   "Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter, 
                   particularly urban walks. </p>

                <h2>Mask-Free Gym Arena For Everyone...</h2>
                <p>In the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom, hiking means walking outdoors on a trail, 
                   or off trail, for recreational purposes.[6] A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, 
                   in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called 
                   hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes hill or mountain 
                   walks, as fell is the common word for both features there.

                    Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking 
                    through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of 
                    bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The 
                    Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking.[7] Common terms for hiking used by New Zealanders are 
                    tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips),[8] walking or bushwalking. 
                    
                    Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North 
                    America, South America, Iran, and the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred 
                    to as trekking and as thru-hiking in some places.[9] In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, are referred to 
                    as backpacking.[6]</p>
